* I'm a first-year Ph.D student in the School of Humanities and Social Science of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.
* I worked as an Senior Algorithm Engineer in [Mininglamp Technology](https://www.mininglamp.com/) during 2021-2023.
* I'm very lucky to worked as research assistant under the supervise of Prof. [XIA Ying](https://sog.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/XiaYing) during 2021-2023.
* My research interests lie in the general area of Computational Social Science, Public Opinions, Social Networks. My field of work now is mainly machine learning, deep learning and Natural Language Processing.

* My name written in Chinese is *林阔*. You may call me *Andrew* in English or *Lam* in Cantonese.

* I don't use social media like Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, even though I might have accidentally registered them before.
