* I'm an algorithm engineer in [Mininglamp Technology](https://www.mininglamp.com/).
* I'm very lucky to work as research assistant unter the supervise of Prof. [XIA Ying](https://sog.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/XiaYing).
* My research interests lie in the general area of Computational Social Science, Public Opinions, Social Networks. My work is mainly about Natural Language Processing.

* My name written in Chinese is *林阔*. You may call me *Andrew* in English or *Lam* in Cantonese.

* I don't use social media like Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, even though I might have accidentally registered them before.
